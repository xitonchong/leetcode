Input : 1 2 3
        2 3 1
        1 1 1
Output : 1 1
         0 2
If we start from 1, 1 we can cover 6 
vertices in the order (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) 
-> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2). We cannot cover
the entire matrix with this vertex. Remaining 
vertices can be covered (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0). 

Input : 3 3
        1 1
Output : 0 1
If we start from 0, 1, we can traverse 
the entire matrix from this single vertex 
in this order (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0). 
Traversing the matrix in this order 
satisfies all the conditions stated above.
